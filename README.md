# Purpose

There are many good styleguides already available for Angular: [here](https://github.com/toddmotto/angular-styleguide) and [here](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide)  So, why do we need another one?

This styleguide is different in that it is focused on teaching & learning Angular.  The syntax and structures advocated by other styleguides are great if you're already an Angular guru with plenty of experience, but can be extremely difficult for students new to Angular, with varying levels of JS knowledge to understand.  When we teach we generally increase complexity over time.  This guide aims to set guidelines to ensure that syntax across lessons is the same, while slowly introducing additional syntactical complexity.

**tldr; This style-guide is aimed at students new to Angular, not angular professionals.**

# Guidelines

### define named functions for each component
Declare named functions for controllers and other components.

```js
angular
  .module('app', [])
  .controller('MainController', function MainController () {

  });
```

Better:

```js
angular
  .module('app', [])
  .controller('MainController', MainController);


function MainController () {

}
 ```

### Use dot chaining to build the app rather than repetition of an app variable
In general multi-line dot-chaining is more prone to error, but since we're also avoiding in-line call-backs, the issue should be greatly reduced and overall readability should remain high.  This also follows what other style-guides suggest.  

```js
var app = angular.module('app', []);
app.controller('MainController', function() {
});
```

Better:

```js
angular
  .module('app', [])
  .controller('MainController', MainController);
```

# Naming

### Suffix should identify the type of module.

Use `mapController` rather than `map`. Use `phoneService` rather than `phone`

### Use UpperCamelCase for controllers, directives, etc.

Some style guides use UpperCamelCase such as `DoAwesomeController`.  This is primarily in preparation for ES6 and classes.  While not absolutely necessary, being consistent about this keeps it clear.

```
function libraryController() { }
function authorDirective() { }
```

Better:

```
function LibraryController() { }
function AuthorDirective() { }
```

### use long-form names for controllers and other components

Use `mapController` not `mapCtrl`.

### Filenames identify component separated by `.`

The syntax should be `{feature}.{component}.js` or `logger.service.js`, `library.controller.js`.


<!-- DIRECTIVES -->
# When working with custom directives
Use these guidelines when introducing and working with directives.

### Directives not controllers should manipulate the DOM.

In general DOM manipulations should be done in directives not controllers or services.  This excludes built-ins such as `ngShow`, `ngHide`, angular animations and templates. CSS and animations can also be used independently.

[code from](https://github.com/toddmotto/angular-styleguide#directives)

### Don't in-line functions in directives

### Don't ng-* prefix directives.

This could conflict with newer versions.

### Custom directive elements should not be prefixed with `data-`, *data- only applies to attributes*

# When working with factories and services
Use these guidelines when introducing factories and services.

### Factories vs. Services

Use Services.  Services and Factories are exceedingly similar and the differences are very tricky.  We don't need to teach both.  Services are closer to the way we teach controllers and should therefore be easier for students.  They also look similar to the way we teach constructors. :sunflower:

> This does not conform with [John Papa's styleguide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md#style-y040). which recommends Factories over Services, but Services are more similar to our controller style. Just pick one and stay consistent!

```js
// factory
function someFactory(){
  var dataObj = {};
  dataObj.doSomething = function(){
	//...
  }
  return dataObj;
}
```

Better:

```js
// service
function someService() {
  this.doSomething = function(){
	//â€¦
  }
}
```

### Do not call Factories services or Services factories

Calling a Factory a Service or naming it `someService` is confusing.  The difference between the two is already [quite](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14324451/angular-service-vs-angular-factory) [confusing](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16596569/angularjs-what-is-a-factory) without mixing up the terminology.  


# When introducing minification
Use these rules when working with MEAN or Rails+Angular stacks or anywhere else where you might encounter minification.  They can be introduced after students have gained some familiarity with Angular.

### Use $inject vs. inline annotation for dependency injection

Use `$inject` vs. inline annotation.  

This has better readability and lower likelihood of syntax errors.  Try to keep the `$inject` call directly above the function it refers to.  You can also align the functions parameters with the injected strings to make this more obvious.

* This rule is a good one to follow from the beginning.  Students can get used to seeing it every time.

```js
angular
  .module('app')
  .controller('PhoneController', ['$location', '$routeParams', PhoneController]);

function PhoneController($location, $routeParams) {...}
```

Better:

```js
angular
  .module('app')
  .controller('PhoneController', PhoneController);

PhoneController.$inject = ['$location', '$routeParams'];
function PhoneController($location, $routeParams) {...}
```

Or (if you're OCD):

```js
// aligned
PhoneController.$inject = ['$location', '$routeParams'];
function PhoneController(   $location,   $routeParams ) {...}
```

> For a comparison see the [official angular tutorial](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_05)


#### Consider using `ng-strict-di` with `$inject`

If you're following the above use of `$inject` ng-annotate is unnecessary.  However, you should consider using `ng-strict-di` to alert you to missing annotations.  [Reference](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngApp)

Better:

```js
<div ng-app="ngAppStrictDemo" ng-strict-di>
```
