**tldr; This style-guide is aimed at developers new to Angular**

# Guidelines

### define named functions for each component
Declare named functions for controllers and other components.

```js
angular
  .module('app', [])
  .controller('MainController', function MainController () {

  });
```

Better:

```js
angular
  .module('app', [])
  .controller('MainController', MainController);


function MainController () {

}
 ```

### Use dot chaining to build the app rather than repetition of an app variable
In general multi-line dot-chaining is more prone to error, but since we're also avoiding in-line call-backs, the issue should be greatly reduced and overall readability should remain high.  This also follows what other style-guides suggest.  

```js
var app = angular.module('app', []);
app.controller('MainController', function() {
});
```

Better:

```js
angular
  .module('app', [])
  .controller('MainController', MainController);
```

# Naming

### Suffix should identify the type of module.

Use `mapController` rather than `map`. Use `phoneService` rather than `phone`

### Use UpperCamelCase for controllers, directives, etc.

Some style guides use UpperCamelCase such as `DoAwesomeController`.  This is primarily in preparation for ES6 and classes.  While not absolutely necessary, being consistent about this keeps it clear.

```
function libraryController() { }
function authorDirective() { }
```

Better:

```
function LibraryController() { }
function AuthorDirective() { }
```

### use long-form names for controllers and other components

Use `mapController` not `mapCtrl`.

### Filenames identify component separated by `.`

The syntax should be `{feature}.{component}.js` or `logger.service.js`, `library.controller.js`.


<!-- DIRECTIVES -->
# When working with custom directives
Use these guidelines when introducing and working with directives.

### Directives not controllers should manipulate the DOM.

In general DOM manipulations should be done in directives not controllers or services.  This excludes built-ins such as `ngShow`, `ngHide`, angular animations and templates. CSS and animations can also be used independently.

[More on Directives](https://github.com/toddmotto/angular-styleguide#directives)

### Don't in-line functions in directives

### Don't ng-* prefix directives.

This could conflict with newer versions.

### Custom directive elements should not be prefixed with `data-`, *data- only applies to attributes*

# When working with factories and services
Use these guidelines when introducing factories and services.

### Factories vs. Services

Use Factories.  Services and Factories are exceedingly similar and the differences are very tricky.  We don't need to teach both.  This is what is recommended in [John Papa's styleguide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md#style-y040). In the end, what is important is that we just pick one and stay consistent!

```js
// service
function someService() {
  this.doSomething = function(){
	//â€¦
  }
}
```

Better:

```js
// factory
function someFactory(){
  var dataObj = {};
  dataObj.doSomething = function(){
	//...
  }
  return dataObj;
}
```

### Do not call Factories services or Services factories

Calling a Factory a Service or naming it `someService` is confusing.  The difference between the two is already [quite](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14324451/angular-service-vs-angular-factory) [confusing](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16596569/angularjs-what-is-a-factory) without mixing up the terminology.  


# When introducing minification
Use these rules when working with MEAN or Rails+Angular stacks or anywhere else where you might encounter minification.  They can be introduced after developers have gained some familiarity with Angular.

### Use $inject vs. inline annotation for dependency injection

Use `$inject` vs. inline annotation.  

This has better readability and lower likelihood of syntax errors.  Try to keep the `$inject` call directly above the function it refers to.  You can also align the functions parameters with the injected strings to make this more obvious.

```js
angular
  .module('app')
  .controller('PhoneController', ['$location', '$routeParams', PhoneController]);

function PhoneController($location, $routeParams) {...}
```

Better:

```js
angular
  .module('app')
  .controller('PhoneController', PhoneController);

PhoneController.$inject = ['$location', '$routeParams'];
function PhoneController($location, $routeParams) {...}
```

Or (if you're OCD):

```js
// aligned
PhoneController.$inject = ['$location', '$routeParams'];
function PhoneController(   $location,   $routeParams ) {...}
```

> For a comparison see the [official angular tutorial](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_05)


#### Consider using `ng-strict-di` with `$inject`

If you're following the above use of `$inject` ng-annotate is unnecessary.  However, you should consider using `ng-strict-di` to alert you to missing annotations.  [Reference](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngApp)

Better:

```js
<div ng-app="ngAppStrictDemo" ng-strict-di>
```
